cards[1]=new card("story", "At 0439 today, HQ Intel detected a spike in power signatures in a location thought to be an enemy base. Scouts were sent out to investigate and reported a strange power-generating installation 400km south of here. The installation bears no resemblance to existing power generators known to be used by the enemy, except for the massive power signature it's emanating. We don't know where it's getting its power from, we just know there's a lot of it. And that's not a good thing. Enemy presence is heavy but the scouts have found a way in where defenses areâ€¦ less than elsewhere in the perimeter. HQ Command has decided to send a small surgical strike team to take out the installation and egress before the rest of the enemy defense can respond.", 2);
cards[2]=new card("story", "'Less than elsewhere in the perimeter?' asks Torvik, your warrior-class tank. 'CRUD! It's not like the damn scouts found us a backdoor we could walk in through. There aren't any less guards there than at the front gate. Why is Command sending us in with only a three-man squad?' 'You know Command's been itching to throw our squad in the brig since that incident with Alpha squad,' replies Raiden, your scout sniper. 'This is just their way of telling us they still care. Whatever Command wants to dish out, I say, 'Bring it!'' Your three-man squad has been tasked to take out a key power-generating installation in enemy territory. Do you accept the mission?", { "No, this sounds fishy." : 3, "Hell yeah, bring it!" : 4 });

That means jumping off the dropship bay as the craft comes within 10 meters off the ground. Fortunately your power armor was built to withstand that kind of impact. Just about. ... 'THUMP!' Not the quietest of landings. Your perso-radar detects enemy signatures moving towards your location. It seems an enemy patrol might have noticed your landing.

As your craft flies off, all three of you are a little disturbed to see swirling thermal winds emanating from the core, containing what look like shadows of screaming faces. You'd have dismissed what you saw for adrenalin-induced hallucinations or just plain fatigue, if it weren't for the screams... (To be continued.)", 44);
