protoRPG is a JavaScript library for building role-playing games containing objects and methods for the following game features:

1. Character system
	- 3 races
		- human
		- elf
		- orc
	- 3 character classes 
		- warrior: +10% health, +10% strength
		- mage: -10% health, +30% intelligence
		- rogue: +20% dexterity

2. Character attribute system
	- strength - increases damage
	- dexterity - increases chances of attack first and hit
	- intelligence - increases chances of hit and damage for magic attacks
	- health

3. Adventure script card (event) system
	- hypercard/storyboard event-based system
	- adventure defined by an array of card objects
	- each event/turn defined by a card object
		- script card
			- [card#] = position in cards array
			- [card type]
				- [story]
				- [encounter]
					- pre-defined enemy, or
					- random enemy
						- generate enemy
						- enemy's attributes depend on player's level

				- [loot]
					- pre-defined loot, or
					- random loot
						- generate loot
						- add loot to inventory
				- [random]
					- 50% chance of story ("nothing happened")
					- 10% chance of loot
					- 40% chance of encounter
			- [card content] e.g. story text, pre-defined loot, pre-defined/boss enemy or null
			- [next card#]
                		- choice functionality baked into story cards using branching syntax for next card# (see sample_adventure.js for syntax explanation)
              - integrate card system into event system
              		- next button progresses through card array using next card#
              		- process card based on card type

X. Event system (deprecated in favour of adventure script card system)
	- Encounters
		- each move 40% chance of encounter
		- generate enemy
		- enemy's attributes depend on player's level
	- Find loot
		- each move 10% chance of finding loot
		- generate loot
		- add loot to inventory

4. Combat system
	- Roll to see who attacks first
		- chance of attack first = 50%+dexterity modifier
		- dex mod = (playerdex-enemydex)/(playerdex+enemydex)\*50%
	- Attacker rolls to see if hit
		- chance of hit = 50%+dexterity modifier
		- if magic attack, use intelligence modifier instead of dex mod (same calculation as dex mod)
	- If hit, attacker rolls for damage
		- depends on weapon
		- depends on strength modifier
		- if magic attack, use intelligence modifier instead of str mod
		- player str mod = (1+((this.strength-enemy.strength)/(this.strength+enemy.strength))\*0.5)%
		- enemy str mod = (1+((enemy.strength-this.strength)/(this.strength+enemy.strength))\*0.5)%
	- continue until someone dies or runs away
	- Run away
		- chance of getting away = 30%+dexterity modifier
		- if fail, enemy gets free attack first
	- If win
		- Find loot
		- Gain XP

5. Weapon system
	- weapon object
		- minimum damage
		- damage range
		- type - physical or magic
	- weapon determines damage
	- class-specific weapons
		- warrior
			- mini-howitzer 8-12 damage
		- mage
			- psychic strike 3-6 (magic)
			- psychic blast 4-8 (magic)
		- rogue
			- sniper rifle 3-6
		- all
			- dagger 1-2
			- sword 3-6
			- auto-rifle 4-8

6. Inventory system
	- 8 items max
	- Must arm main weapon
	- medikits
	- use item
	- drop item
	- equip weapon in main hand

7. Leveling system
	- xp gained converts to ap (attribute points) which can be assigned to attributes
	- xp:ap conversion function (10:1)
	- xp converts to level which determines level of enemy encountered
	- xp:level conversion function (10:1)
